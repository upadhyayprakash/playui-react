## Installation

To install the `playui-react` using `npm`:
```sh
npm install playui-react
```

## Usage

The `playui-react` component library can be installed in any React project. As the components are shipped with type declarations, developers can easily explore the props and their allowed values.

1. Install the `playui-react` from `npm` registry.
    ```sh
    npm install playui-react
    ```
2. Use in React component.
    ```jsx
    import { Button, ThemeProvider } from "playui-react";

    function App() {
      return (
        <>
          <ThemeProvider mode="dark">
            <Button 
              size="large"
              variant="primary"
              onClick={() => alert("Clicked!")}
            >
              Primary Button
            </Button>
          </ThemeProvider>
        </>
      );
    }

    export default App;
    ```

### Integrating the `playui-react` storybook

It's recommended that you also integrate our publicly hosted `playui-react` storybook within your React project.

Youâ€™ll be able to browse the design system components and docs while developing your app.

In your `.stroybook/main.ts` file, add following config,

```ts
// ...
  refs: {
    "design-system": {
      title: 'PlayUI Design System',
      //ðŸ‘‡ The public url of 'playui-react' storybook
      url: 'https://upadhyayprakash.github.io/playui-react',
    },
  },
// ...
```

> [!NOTE]
> Showcasing the design system during feature development increases the likelihood that developers will reuse existing components instead of wasting time inventing their own.
